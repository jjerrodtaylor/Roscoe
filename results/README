Summary
-------
The Yioop search engine consists of three main
scripts: 

bin/fetcher.php - used to download batches of urls provided
    the queue_server. 
bin/queue_server.php - maintains a queue of urls that are
    going to be scheduled to be seen. It also keeps
    track of what has been seen and robots.txt info.
    Its last responsibility is to create the index_archive
    that is used by the search front end.

index.php -- a search engine web page. It is also used
    to handle message passing between the fetchers 
    (multiple machines can act as fetchers) and the
    queue_server.
